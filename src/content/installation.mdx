## Getting started

##### Installation
To install **Pixelact UI**, you can use npm.

```bash 
npm install pixelact-ui
```
<br />

After installing, **import the CSS** in your main CSS file. This
is required in order to apply the default styles to the
components.

```jsx
import '@pixelact-ui/styles.css';
```
<br />

#### Usage
To use **Pixelact UI** components, import them into your code
like this:

```jsx
import { PixelButton } from '@pixelact-ui/react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <PixelButton variant="primary">Click me</PixelButton>
  );
}
```
<br />

#### Styling
Pixelact UI components are built on top of
**shadcn/ui** components. Every customization
that can be done on shadcn/ui components can be done on Pixelact UI components
as well using Tailwind CSS.


#### Theme support
The components are designed to work with both light and dark themes. You can
easily override the styles changing the CSS variables in the root element of
the main CSS file.
